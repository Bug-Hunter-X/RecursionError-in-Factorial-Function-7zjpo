This repository demonstrates a common Python error: a RecursionError caused by improper handling of the base case in a recursive function. The `factorial_bug.py` file contains the buggy code, which causes infinite recursion when a negative number is provided as input. The solution, provided in `factorial_solution.py`, addresses this by explicitly checking for and handling negative input.
